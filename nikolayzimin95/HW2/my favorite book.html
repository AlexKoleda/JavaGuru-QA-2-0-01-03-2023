			<p align="justify"><b><u>short review:</b></u>In 1914 a room full of German schoolboys, fresh-faced and idealistic, 
		      are goaded by their schoolmaster to troop off to the ‘glorious war’. With the fire and patriotism of youth they sign up. 
		      What follows is the moving story of a young ‘unknown soldier’ experiencing the horror and disillusionment of life in the trenches.</p>
