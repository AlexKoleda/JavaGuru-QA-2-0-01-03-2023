- All books are science fiction except the last one, which is a dark humor thriller.
- You might notice that there is almost no information about the books' plots or story lines. This is intentional.
I am VERY sensitive to any kind of spoilers, including book covers, which reveal many important story moments that really make the book 100 times less enjoyable. (Most of the time these are written by publishers and not writers).
- If you want to try any if these, I would suggest to just start reading or listening.
