	<p><img src="https://cdn.tasteatlas.com/images/toplistarticles/08c818739e4b48ce96d319c16f4cc0ca.jpg?m=facebook" width=300 class="leftimg">I like a simple burger with onion, lettuce, tomato, bacon, mayo, and mustard. But, I also like to get creative with ingredients like goat cheese and roasted red peppers.Burgers are so easy to customize all sorts of toppings and patty options.<br></p1><br>

    <h2>Hot dogs</h2>
	<p><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/552f35bee4b0955308211538/1466836218748-WU370TFJHZIT8G4T9E4S/Yummy+Dogs+-+10+Fun+Facts+about+Hot+Dogs+in+America.jpg?format=750w" width=300 class="leftimg">Hot dogs are a common food item found in backyard barbeques all over America.They are a cheap and easy way to feed many people, but they can also taste incredible. A hot dog is made in many ways, but they are pork or beef sausage cooked and placed between a long bread bun. People top hot dogs with popular condiments like mustard, ketchup, and pickle relish, but you can go crazy customizing them.<br></p>

    <h2>Apple pie</h2>
	<p><img src="https://www.swing-the-whisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Yummy-American-Apple-Pie.jpg" width=300 class="leftimg">It is a simple dessert served at many events, sold at almost any grocery store, and offered at many restaurants.Apple pie consists of a sugary apple filling, often spiced with cinnamon, surrounded by a flaky dough crust on all sides. Sometimes people will get very creative with the pie covering, even going as far as to create a lace pattern that looks like art.<br></p></b>
