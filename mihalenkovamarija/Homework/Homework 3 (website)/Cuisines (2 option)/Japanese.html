			<font size=+1><font color=black><center>Japanese curry (カレー, karē) is a dish that is hugely popular in Japan. It is readily available at various restaurants, and many households cook it at home too. As the curry is usually served with rice, you would hear the term "curry rice" (カレーライス, karē raisu) mentioned often.
After importing curry from India, the Europeans invented curry powder so that the layman could cook curry without having to master the intricacies about spices. This form of curry was introduced to Japan during the Meji Period (1868-1912), from which the Japanese adapted the dish to suit their tastes.</center><br>
