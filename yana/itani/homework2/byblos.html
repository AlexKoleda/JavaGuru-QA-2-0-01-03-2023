                    Byblos is one of the 20 oldest cities in the world. It has been continuously inhabited ever since it was established in 5,000 B.C.<br>
                    According to a legend, the city was built by the god Cronus as the first city in Phoenicia. In Greek mythology, Cronus is the titan of the harvest.<br>
                    Byblos is associated with the history of the diffusion of the Phoenician alphabet.<br>
                    The first inscription in the Phoenician alphabet was found on the sarcophagus of Ahiram who was the king of Byblos!<br>
                    Byblos was located on the trade route where merchants exported papyrus from Egypt to Greece.<br>
                    Byblos was officially recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984.<br>
