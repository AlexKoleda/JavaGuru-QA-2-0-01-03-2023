                    Under Ottoman rule, Beirut became the capital of a large coastal area between Palestine and Syria <br>
                    The American University of Beirut is the oldest university in Lebanon, founded in 1866 <br>
                    By 1900, Beirut was viewed as the leader of Arabic journalism <br>
                    The pupulation of the city is equally populated by Christians and Muslims<br>
                    Beirut was occupied by allied forces after World War I and was part of the French Mandate from 1920 to 1943 until Lebanon was granted independence
