			<p><h2 style="color:08540D">About the author:</h2></p>

			<p><h3 style="text-align:justify;font-style:italic;">Raised under a Christian standard in what is now known as East Riding of Yorkshire, England, Emily Brontë grew up to become a talented writer and poet whose works are well celebrated today. Along with her talented sisters, she went on and published some impressive collections of poems along with her monumental – and only – novel ‘Wuthering Heights.’Aside from ‘Wuthering Heights,’ Emily did author more than two hundred pieces of poetry – including those she co-authored with her sisters, Anne and Charlotte. Of the Brontë sisters, Emily was always considered a far better poet, and she began exhibiting her superior ability from a very tender age, even though she struggled to get her first, earliest works published and ultimately lost most of them.</h3></p>

							
		<p><h2 style="color:08540D">Interesting facts:</h2></p>

			<p><h3 style="color:40430B;font-family:TimesNewRoman;text-align:justify;">The world remembers Emily Brontë today for ‘Wuthering Heights,’ but it may come as a shock to many knowing that the author did publish her acclaimed novel under the false name ’Ellis Bell.’</h3></p> 

			<p><h3 style="color:40430B;font-family:TimesNewRoman;text-align:justify;">Emily Brontë lived only thirty years, yet her literary creativity within this short span has lasted more than a century.</h3></p>

Most of the book’s perspectives are drawn from the eyes of this woman. Ellen Dean, or Nelly, knows a great deal about the history of both the Earnshaws and the Lintons.</td></h3>

		<tr>
			<td><h3>Heathcliff</td><td><h3>A dark outsider brought into the family by Mr. Earnshaw, father of Linton Heathcliff. As a child, Heathcliff is described as cute and likable – and this might be part of the reasons he catches the eyes of his adopter, and later his half-sister, Catherine. However, Heathcliff soon grows into a callous, not wicked, young, mean man – driven by his resolve to exact revenge on Hindley for degrading him, and on Edgar, for taking Catherine away from him.</td></h3>

			<td><h3>Edgar Linton</td><td><h3>Son of Mr. Linton, husband to Catherine Earnshaw (Linton), father of Catherine Linton. He is the son of the Lintons, the first owners of Thrushcross Grange.

Isabella is a sister to Edgar, and like him, she is enlightened and informed.

She marries Heathcliff, but suffers horrible marital treatments, often thinking about running away</td></h3>

			<td><h3>Hindley Earnshaw</td><td><h3>Brother of Catherine Earnshaw, father of Hareton Earnshaw. Hindley is Mr. Earnshaw’s biological son who, for most of the book, goes into warring with Heathcliff, as he sees him as a huge obstacle to obtaining his full right as an Earnshaw. </td></h3>

		</tr>
	
		<tr>
			<td><h3>Linton Heathcliff</td><td><h3>Son of Heathcliff and Isabella Linton (Heathcliff), husband of Catherine Linton. He is the only child and son of Heathcliff and Isabella, born frail and sickly.

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">1801. - I have just returned from a visit to my landlord - the solitary neighbour that I shall be troubled with. This is certainly a beautiful country! In all England, I do not believe that I could have fixed on a situation so completely removed from the stir of society. A perfect misanthropist's heaven: and Mr. Heathcliff and I are such a suitable pair to divide the desolation between us. A capital fellow! He little imagined how my heart warmed towards him when I beheld his black eyes withdraw so suspiciously under their brows, as I rode up, and when his fingers sheltered themselves, with a jealous resolution, still further in his waistcoat, as I announced my name.</h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">'Mr. Heathcliff?' I said.</h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">A nod was the answer.</h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">'Mr. Lockwood, your new tenant, sir. I do myself the honour of calling as soon as possible after my arrival, to express the hope that I have not inconvenienced you by my perseverance in soliciting the occupation of Thrushcross Grange: I heard yesterday you had had some thoughts - ' </h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">'Thrushcross Grange is my own, sir,' he interrupted, wincing. 'I should not allow any one to inconvenience me, if I could hinder it - walk in!' </h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">The 'walk in' was uttered with closed teeth, and expressed the sentiment, 'Go to the Deuce:' even the gate over which he leant manifested no sympathising movement to the words; and I think that circumstance determined me to accept the invitation: I felt interested in a man who seemed more exaggeratedly reserved than myself</h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">When he saw my horse's breast fairly pushing the barrier, he did put out his hand to unchain it, and then sullenly preceded me up the causeway, calling, as we entered the court, - 'Joseph, take Mr. Lockwood's horse; and bring up some wine.' </h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">'Here we have the whole establishment of domestics, I suppose,' was the reflection suggested by this compound order. 'No wonder the grass grows up between the flags, and cattle are the only hedge-cutters.' Joseph was an elderly, nay, an old man: very old, perhaps, though hale and sinewy. 'The Lord help us!' he soliloquised in an undertone of peevish displeasure, while relieving me of my horse: looking, meantime, in my face so sourly that I charitably conjectured he must have need of divine aid to digest his dinner, and his pious ejaculation had no reference to my unexpected advent. </h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">Wuthering Heights is the name of Mr. Heathcliff's dwelling. 'Wuthering' being a significant provincial adjective, descriptive of the atmospheric tumult to which its station is exposed in stormy weather. Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones.</h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date '1500,' and the name 'Hareton Earnshaw.' I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. </h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here 'the house' pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses. </h4><br>

	<h4 style="color:101210;font-family:TimesNewRoman;">The apartment and furniture would have been nothing extraordinary as belonging to a homely, northern farmer, with a stubborn countenance, and stalwart limbs set out to advantage in knee-breeches and gaiters. Such an individual seated in his arm-chair, his mug of ale frothing on the round table before him, is to be seen in any circuit of five or six miles among these hills, if you go at the right time after dinner. But Mr. Heathcliff forms a singular contrast to his abode and style of living. He is a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect, in dress and manners a gentleman: that is, as much a gentleman as many a country squire: rather slovenly, perhaps, yet not looking amiss with his negligence, because he has an erect and handsome figure; and rather morose. Possibly, some people might suspect him of a degree of under-bred pride; I have a sympathetic chord within that tells me it is nothing of the sort: I know, by instinct, his reserve springs from an aversion to showy displays of feeling - to manifestations of mutual kindliness. He'll love and hate equally under cover, and esteem it a species of impertinence to be loved or hated again. No, I'm running on too fast: I bestow my own attributes over-liberally on him. Mr. Heathcliff may have entirely dissimilar reasons for keeping his hand out of the way when he meets a would-be acquaintance, to those which actuate me. Let me hope my constitution is almost peculiar: my dear mother used to say I should never have a comfortable home; and only last summer I proved myself perfectly unworthy of one. </h4><br>
