"Wuthering Heights" is a gothic novel by Emily Bronte.
Raised under a Christian standard in what is now known as East Riding of Yorkshire, England,
Emily Brontë grew up to become a talented writer and poet whose works are well celebrated today. Along with her talented sisters,
she went on and published some impressive collections of poems along with her monumental – and only – novel ‘Wuthering Heights.
’Aside from ‘Wuthering Heights,’ Emily did author more than two hundred pieces of poetry – including those she co-authored with her sisters,
Anne and Charlotte. Of the Brontë sisters,
Emily was always considered a far better poet, and she began exhibiting her superior ability from a very tender age,
even though she struggled to get her first,
earliest works published and ultimately lost most of them.
